            Sorry, something went very very wrong. If you're brave, try again.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you are less brave, get in touch with the webmasters and give them all your
            love and support, because they probably need it right now. You may also want to
            tell them about this issue you're having with the site.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you are the web master, you'd better go and look in the logs for details of
            the error. You probably want to start with <code>web_error_log</code>. You could
            change the config and set <code>DEBUG = True</code> in
            <code>local_settings.py</code> if you'd like to see stack traces on web pages
            rather than in logs.
